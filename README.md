# WazuhSIEM
Wazuh, ELK, Kibana, Python, Docker



This repo will include everything that will you need to build a efficient, automated, and relatively lightweight SIEM solution that will incorporate automation, visualization, and automated alerts sent through email by leveraging python to interact with Wazuh's API. I will also include commands to set up the docker engine, docker compose, pulling the right container images and so forth. Will be a relatively straight through walkthrough that hopefully will help you incorporate or at least draw inspiration from to implement in your desired sitatuion.
